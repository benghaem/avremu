## avremu: An ATTiny45 Emulator Written in C

This is my attempt to write a functional emulator of the ATTiny45 in C. My goal is to learn more about the AVR architecture and practice C in general. 

Currently the following high level concepts have been implemented:

* Instruction decoding (automatically generated)
* Memory interactions
* IO Register Naming
* Intel HEX file format decoding

##Building

Currently there is not much to build, but check back soon!
